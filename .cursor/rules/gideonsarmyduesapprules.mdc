# Cursor Rules for Gideon's Army Dues Management App

## Project Structure
- API routes should be organized under `/pages/api/`.
- Server-side logic must be in `/lib/`.
- Reusable React components go under `/components/`.
- Utility/helper functions must be placed in `/utils/`.
- Pages should remain minimal, focusing on data-fetching and displaying content.

## Authentication
- Use **NextAuth.js** with the **Credentials Provider**.
- Passwords must be securely hashed with **bcrypt** before saving.
- Never expose password hashes to the frontend.

## Authorization
- Implement roles: "member" and "admin".
- Protect admin-only routes by checking the user's session and role.
- Always fetch sessions server-side using `getServerSession()`.

## Google Sheets API
- Only access Google Sheets from server-side API routes or `/lib/` functions.
- Helper functions for interacting with Google Sheets must be inside `/lib/googleSheets.ts`.
- Use batch reads/writes where possible to optimize performance.
- Never expose Google credentials to the frontend.

## API Routes
- API routes that modify data must only accept **POST** or **PATCH** requests.
- Validate and sanitize all incoming request data.
- Return consistent JSON responses structured as:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Your message here",
    "data": {...}
  }
